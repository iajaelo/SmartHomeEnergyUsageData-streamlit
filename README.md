# Smart Home Energy Usage Dataset

This dataset simulates the daily energy consumption patterns of smart homes equipped with IoT-based sensors and appliances. It contains readings for temperature, humidity, lighting, motion sensors, and energy usage of multiple devices such as HVAC systems, water heaters, and general home appliances.
It’s ideal for machine learning experiments on energy optimization, anomaly detection, and smart-home automation modeling.
